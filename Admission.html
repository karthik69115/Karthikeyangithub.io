            <h2>Admission Policy</h2>
            <p>New admissions are generally accepted in the final phase of the academic year for the oncoming academic year. Following procedure has been adopted to facilitate the parents/ guardians seeking admission for their wards. We are an inclusive school that welcomes children from all backgrounds but we are restricted from admitting SEN students provisionally. However, some SEN students with the least number of challenges are admitted.
              
              All applications will be treated on merit and in a sensitive manner.
              
              If the number of children applying for entry exceeds the places available, we enforce the procedure set out below in order to determine whether a child is accepted or not. It is our wish to allow parents the right to have a place at the school of their choice. However, this is not always possible, due to the application for admission exceeding seats available.
              
              Children from the neighbourhood, siblings and staff children are given first preference in case of application outnumbering seat availability.
              
              In other cases, picking-lots may be depended on fair means.
              
              The students who seek admission to the classes from KG-02 to Gr.09 from diverse academic backgrounds will have to undergo a test in English, Science and Mathematics to ascertain if the student is ready for the class applied for. We offer a lower class if there is a serious gap in fundamentals.
              
              When a child applies for admission, as much information as possible is obtained from previous schools/nurseries. The initial interview will often be conducted before this information is available, but the child will usually make a second visit to the school when all the information has been gathered and discussed. This will enable the child to undergo an informal assessment with the Special Educator/ Counsellor. All children are regularly reviewed and the allocation of extra provision can be adjusted according to performance in school.
              
              All help given to children with SEN is directed towards helping them gain greater access to the curriculum. This is achieved through extensive use of all forms of differentiation, accommodations where and if necessary. Every effort is made to integrate children with SEN into all of the school activities.</p>
