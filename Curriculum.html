          <h2>Curriculum Overview</h2>
          <p>We are affiliated to the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE), New Delhi and we are also recognized by the Ministry of Education, UAE.  NIS adheres to a strict educational course of action and extra-curricular activities that inspire the highest levels of overall academic excellence among all students

            We have a positive ethos with a climate of respect and trust where children are supported and listened to. Our pupils have a sense of pride in our school and are happy to learn here at NIS. At each stage of our pupils’ education, they have a chance to contribute to the ethos and life of the school. We have a School Cabinet which all pupils from Grade 01 to Grade 10 are involved in and they are establishing themselves as a voice group through representation from every class, club and other leading positions.
            
            Through different focused activities we are enhancing our learner’s confidence and creating responsible citizens who know that their opinions are valued and respected.</p>
